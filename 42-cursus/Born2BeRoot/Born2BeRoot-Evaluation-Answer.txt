___Project Overview___

A virtual machine (VM) is a software emulation of a physical computer system. It allows you to run multiple operating systems and applications on a single physical machine, enabling greater efficiency in resource utilization and flexibility in managing computing environments.

Virtual machine and its benefits.

Virtual Hardware
Hypervisor | A hypervisor allows one host computer to support multiple guest VMs by virtually sharing its resources, such as memory and processing.
Guest Operating System
Resource Allocation
Isolation.

Benefits

Multiple Environments on single hardware
Isolation and Security
Flexibility and Scalability
Hardware Independence
Testing and Development

Rocky vs Debian

Rocky

Community Enterprise OS maintained by RedHat
Use the Red Hat Package manager
Focus on stability and not on the latest.
Enterprise
Highly testes
Ideal for the server side

Debian

One of the oldest stable Linux distribution
Wide range of free software
Uses APT and dpkg for package management
Strong community support
Extensive documentation
Perfect for server and production

1. APT (Advanced Package Tool):
   - APT is a package management system used primarily by Debian-based Linux distributions like Ubuntu.
command-line interface CLI only
   - It manages software installation, upgrades, and removals, handling dependencies and ensuring system integrity.
   - APT works with repositories containing software packages, fetching and installing them as needed.

2. Aptitude:
   - Aptitude is a front-end package manager for APT, offering a command-line interface(CLI) and text-based graphical user interface(TUI) similar to APT.
   - It provides more advanced features for package management, such as dependency resolution, package selection, and conflict resolution.
   - Aptitude offers on an interactive mode for browsing, searching, filtering and managing packages, making it popular among power users and system administrators.

3. AppArmor (Application Armor):
   - AppArmor is a Linux security module that restricts programs' capabilities using security profiles.
   - It confines individual programs to a set of rules, limiting their access to certain resources and actions.
   - AppArmor enhances system security by reducing the potential damage caused by compromised applications.
MAC implementation.
Profile used to determine access to the file


___Simple Configuration___


Purpose of the Password Policy
Protect unauthorised access.
Prevention of Brute Force Attacks
Regular Password Change
Minimising Repeat Usage

Advantages
Increased System Protection
Compliance with best practices
User Vigilance
Prevention of Data Breaches

Disadvantages

User Inconvenience
Risk of Forgotten Passwords
False Sense of Security

Check OS
-> cat /etc/os-release | uname -a

UFW status
-> sudo systemctl status ufw

SSH status
-> sudo systemctl status ssh




___User___


User belong to SUDO

-> getent group sudo

User belong to USER42

-> getent group user42

Password policy check

Create new user

-> sudo adduser new_username

Assign a password

-> getent group sudo

Check if the group has been created

-> getent group

Change Password

-> passwd

Password Policy

-> sudo vim /etc/login.defs

Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) system, which manages auth

-> sudo vim /etc/pam.d/common-password

Create new group

-> sudo groupadd group_name[evaluating]

Assign a group to a user

-> sudo usermod -aG evaluating [group_name] thossain2 [new_username]

Check if the new user belongs to the "evaluating" group

-> getent group evaluating [group_name]



___Hostname and Partitions____



Host Name

-> hostnamectl

Modify Host Name 

-> sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname 
-> vim /etc/hosts 
-> sudo reboot

Restore Host Name

-> sudo hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname
-> sudo reboot
 
View Partition

-> lsblk

LVM (Logical Volume Management) advanced method of managing storage space on a Linux system. It provides a higher level of abstraction over physical storage devices, allowing for a more flexible and convenient way to manage disk space than traditional partitioning methods.

Physical Volumes (PVs)
Volume Groups (VGs)
Logical Volumes (LVs)
Filesystems

Benefits
Flexibility
Easier Management
Snapshots
Dynamic Resizing
Striping and Mirroring

Practical Uses
Server Environments
Desktops for Advanced Users
Data centres


___SUDO___


Check if Sudo is Installed

-> dpkg -l | grep sudo or sudo -v

New User Assigned to Sudo Group

-> sudo usermod -aG sudo [new_user]

-> sudo visudo

Log File Path

Defaults    logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo.log"

TTY(TeleTYpewriter) Requirement

Defaults    requiretty

Restricted Paths

Defaults    secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"




___UFW / Firewalled___


UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is a user-friendly interface for managing Netfilter, the default firewall configuration tool for Linux. UFW simplifies the process of configuring a firewall, making it more accessible to users who may not be familiar with complex firewall settings.

Verify UFW(Uncomplicated Firewall) is installed

-> sudo ufw status

Rule-Based Management | Network traffic allowed or denied
Easy Syntax | an easy-to-use command-line interface for creating and managing these rules. 
Default Policies | Set default policies for incoming and outgoing traffic.
Port Management | Open or close specific network ports.
Logging | useful monitoring and troubleshooting 


List the active rules in UFW. A rule must exist for port 4242.

-> sudo ufw status numbered

Add a new rule to open port 8080. Check that this one has been added by listing the active rules.

-> sudo ufw allow 8080

Delete this new rule with the help of the student being evaluated.

-> sudo ufw status numbered
-> sudo ufw delete 4
-> sudo ufw delete 2


___SSH___


SSH (Secure Shell), is a network protocol that provides a secure method for logging into a networked device remotely. It is widely used for securely accessing and managing systems over an unsecured network, like the Internet.

To Restart

-> sudo systemctl restart ssh

Check if it's active 

-> sudo service sshd status

Basic Functionality of SSH

Remote Access 
Encryption 
Authentication 
Port Forwarding
Secure File Transfer

Check the port settings are right

-> sudo grep Port /etc/ssh/sshd_config 

___Script Monitoring___


-> cd /usr/local/bin

-> vim monitoring.sh

What is Cron?

Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. It allows users to schedule commands or scripts to run periodically at fixed time intervals or specified times. Cron jobs are often used for automating repetitive tasks such as backups, system maintenance, and regular report generation.

Set up script execute every 10 minutes

-> sudo crontab -u root -e
-> sudo cronstop
-> sudo cronstart

-> sudo reboot
-> sudo crontab -u root -e

Show monitoring.sh

-> cd /usr/local/bin

Edit the Cron job

-> sudo crontab -u root -e

Change to run every 30s 

-> change script to */1 * * * * sleep 30s && script path


Disable cron

-> sudo systemctl disable corn

Syntax

-> sudo ufw status
-> sudo systemctl status ssh
-> getent group sudo
-> getent group user42
-> sudo adduser new username
-> sudo groupadd groupname
-> sudo usermod -aG groupname username
-> sudo chage -l username - check password expire rules
-> hostnamectl
-> hostnamectl set-hostname new_hostname - to change the current hostname
-> sudo reboot - Restart your Virtual Machine.
-> sudo nano /etc/hosts - change current hostname to new hostname
-> lsblk to display the partitions
-> dpkg -l | grep sudo – to show that sudo is installed
-> sudo ufw status numbered
-> sudo ufw allow port-id
-> sudo ufw delete rule number
-> ssh your_user_id@127.0.0.1 -p 4242 - do this in terminal to show that SSH to port 4242 is working
